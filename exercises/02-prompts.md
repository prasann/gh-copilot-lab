# Exercise 2: Prompts - On-Demand Tasks

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to use Prompts for repeatable tasks that you trigger manually.

## 📝 What You'll Do
Use prompt files to scaffold components and tests on demand.

---

## Step 1: Explore a Prompt

Open [`.github/prompts/create-component.prompt.md`](../.github/prompts/create-component.prompt.md)

Read the prompt definition to understand what it does.

## Step 2: Use the Prompt

In VS Code chat, describe a component:
```
Create a UserCard component with name, email, and avatar props
```

**Look for:**
- Complete React TypeScript component
- Props interface defined
- 🦄 comments (Instructions still apply!)

## Step 3: Try Another Prompt

Open [`.github/prompts/generate-tests.prompt.md`](../.github/prompts/generate-tests.prompt.md)

In chat, request:
```
Generate tests for the UserCard component
```

**Look for:**
- Test file with proper structure
- Multiple test cases
- TypeScript types

- ✅ Prompts are explicit (you choose when to run them)
- ✅ They're templates for repeatable tasks
- ✅ They work WITH instructions

## 💡 When to Use

Use Prompts for:
- Component scaffolding
- Test generation
- Code conversions
- Documentation templates
