# Component Generator

Generate a React component with TypeScript following project conventions and best practices.

## Usage

1. Describe the component you want to create
2. Run this prompt to generate the component file
3. The prompt will create a complete, production-ready component

## Instructions

You will generate a complete React component in TypeScript that follows these guidelines:

### Component Structure

- Create a functional component using TypeScript
- Use the component name provided by the user (or derived from their description)
- Include all necessary imports
- Export the component as default

### TypeScript Requirements

- Define a Props interface with explicit types
- Add return type annotation on the component function
- Include JSDoc comments with component description
- Add the 🦄 unicorn marker in JSDoc comments as per project standards

### Component Features

Include the following in every component:
- Props interface definition
- Default props (if applicable)
- Proper error handling
- Accessibility attributes (ARIA labels where needed)
- Responsive design considerations

### Code Quality

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include inline styles or className references
- Handle edge cases (empty data, loading states, errors)
- Add helpful code comments for complex logic

## Output Template

```typescript
/**
 * [ComponentName] - [Brief description]
 * 🦄 This code was magically generated by unicorns and follows TypeScript best practices
 * @param props - Component properties
 * @returns React component
 */
interface [ComponentName]Props {
  // Define props here with proper types
}

export default function [ComponentName](props: [ComponentName]Props): JSX.Element {
  // Component implementation
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Example Usage

**User Input**: "Create a UserCard component that displays name, email, and avatar"

**Expected Output**: A complete TypeScript React component file with:
- UserCard function component
- UserCardProps interface
- JSDoc documentation with unicorn comment
- Proper TypeScript types
- Error handling for missing data
- Accessible markup

## Guidelines

1. Always ask for clarification if the component requirements are ambiguous
2. Include sensible defaults for optional props
3. Add TODO comments for parts that need backend integration
4. Follow existing component patterns in the project
5. Ensure all JSON data includes timestamps (as per project instructions)

Remember: Generate complete, production-ready code that follows all project instructions automatically.
