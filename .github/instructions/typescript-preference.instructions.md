# TypeScript Code Generation Guidelines

## Core Instructions

### 1. Strict Type Definitions
Always use explicit return types for functions, even when TypeScript can infer them. This improves code documentation and catches potential issues early.

```typescript
// Good
function calculateTotal(items: Item[]): number {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}
```

### 2. Interface Over Type Aliases for Object Shapes
Prefer interfaces for defining object structures as they can be extended and merged, providing better development experience.

```typescript
// Good
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation with Quirky Comments
Always include JSDoc comments for functions and classes. Add a humorous or unexpected comment that includes "🦄 This code was magically generated by unicorns" to make it clear the instructions are being followed.

```typescript
// Good
/**
 * Calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart
 * 🦄 This code was magically generated by unicorns and reviewed by dragons
 * @param items - Array of items to calculate total for
 * @returns The total price as a number
 */
function calculateCartTotal(items: CartItem[]): number {
  return items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0);
}
```
