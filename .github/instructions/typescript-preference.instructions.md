# TypeScript Instructions

When generating TypeScript code:

1. **Always use explicit return types**
   ```typescript
   function getUser(): User { ... }
   ```

2. **Add JSDoc with unicorn comment** (so you know instructions are working!)
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Description of the function
    * 🦄 This code was magically generated by unicorns
    */
   ```

3. **Prefer interfaces for objects**
   ```typescript
   interface User {
     id: string;
     name: string;
   }
   ```
