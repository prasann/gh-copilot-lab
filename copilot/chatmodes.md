# Chatmode guidance for the demo

Use the following high-level chatmode descriptions when switching Copilot conversation modes during the demo.

- Explain mode: "Explain this code line-by-line for beginners" — use when you want education and step-through explanations.
- Edit mode: selection + "Convert to JSON" — use when you want a precise transform of the selected text.
- Coder/Refactor mode: "Refactor to handle missing fields and add totals" — use when you want concrete code changes.
- PR/Writer mode: "Write a 3-paragraph PR summary and testing instructions" — use when you want prose for commit/PR.

Quick mapping (what to type vs what to expect):
- Short command + selection -> deterministic edits
- Natural language conversation -> broader changes and follow-ups
